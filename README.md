# ampVisualizer
visualizing audio files in a fun way (I don't have a proper reason to describe how I am trying to visualize, because I update as I go)

(reason)
literally 0 experience, but It would be cool to learn new things 
- trying to prove baxatecarter right, he said something like, "dont wait for enough knowledge to start, because there is never enough"
- also trying to show that even someone new like me can do something cool lol

(rant)
- currently AM learning new things, but some concepts are very weird. 
- I have a problem with forgetting things really fast though, but I find what I am doing very interesting
